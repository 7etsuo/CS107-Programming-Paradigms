Free free to change any of the supplied class implementations, 
but document that you have done so I know to look for differences.

Be sure that your rsg runs and works without error on the following
grammars:

	excuse.g
	bond.g
	trek.g
	poem.g

The other grammars, while obeying the file format dictated in the
assignment handout, have spurious whitespace and hit the edge
cases of the file format specification.  If you manage to
read in all of these files as well, then you rage. :)  If not,
then dont' worry so much about them.

Also: rsg-sample-solaris runs on the elaines and all other Solaris
machines.  If you're sitting in front of and elaine machine, or you're
ssh'ed into one, then you want to invoke the Solaris version.  If instead
you're working on a myth, hedge, or bramble, then you need to invoke
the linux version instead.  If you try one sample program and it exits
with some polite error message about it being compiled for a different
architecture, then you know to use the other one.

Have fun!
