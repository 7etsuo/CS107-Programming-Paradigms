;; The Where-Am-I helper functions:

;;
;;  the 2-D POINT type  (x and y coordinates)
;;  impelemented as a list length 2
;;
;;  the CIRCLE type (a radius and a center point)
;;  implemented as a list length 2-- first element is the radius and
;;  the second is the center point
;;
;;  For convenience, I do not insist that you treat these as ADT's-
;;  so if you want to use CAR to get the x coordinate, or build you own
;;  circles without going through MAKE-CIRCLE that will be ok.
;; 
;; POINT functions:
;;  make-pt   create a new point
;;  x         get the x coordinate of a point
;;  y         get the y coordinate of a point
;;  dist      return the distance between two points
;;
;; CIRCLE functions
;;  make-circle   create a new circle
;;  radius        get the radius of a circle
;;  center        get the center of a circle
;;  intersect     given two circles, returns a list of the points
;;                of intersection for those circles.
;;                For the purposes of this program I have
;;                bastardized the definition of 'intersect' a little
;;                to give better results when the measurements are
;;                inexact.  Don't worry about that, just use the points
;;                returned.  Someone who is interested in Math or Geometry
;;                might be interested to see how I compute the intersection.
