Welcome to the CS107 RSS Search Engine!


This handy tool pulls and processes a huge number of RSS (Rich Site Summary) pages, 
and then allows for a simple search of those documents.  Currently, the application
operates as a singly threaded application where all feeds are processed sequentially.
In practice, each one of the feeds would be downloaded in its own thread, as would
each of the news articles identified by the feeds.
